        <h3> PROJECTS </h3>
        <h4>Server Database</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Developed a dynamic, user-friendly web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js, featuring login functionality and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user profiles</li>
          <li>Built and deployed a cloud-accessible database using Node.js, enabling multi-device access and seamless data sharing across connected systems</li>
          <li>Resolved complex Node.js integration issues through self-guided research and effective use of AI tools like ChatGPT for debugging and best practices</li>
          <li>Achieved partial backward compatibility with a legacy database by implementing a solution to detect and access old directory structures, preserving historical user data</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Stock Script</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Created a TradingView script using Pine Script to highlight New York trading hours and draw lines based on whether profit/loss was worse than the previous value but better than the next</li>
          <li>Encountered problems with how to dynamically store information, create, and delete a line if you can't access the information anymore in the next tick</li>
          <li>Solved the problem by having arrays and variables that can keep their changed information across all ticks, allowing the script to add or remove lines correctly over time</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Discord Robot</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Developed a Discord betting bot that calculates winner payouts and engages users with random GIFs on request</li>
          <li>Implemented Python's Time Library to accurately track bet durations, ensuring functionality even during bot downtime</li>
          <li>Enhanced user experience by creating a seamless interaction interface and integrating fun features to keep users engaged</li>
        </ul>
